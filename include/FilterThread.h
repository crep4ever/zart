 * This software is a computer program whose purpose is to demonstrate
 * the possibilities of the GMIC image processing language by offering the
 * choice of several manipulations on a video stream aquired from a webcam. In
 * other words, ZArt is a GUI for G'MIC real-time manipulations on the output
 * of a webcam.
